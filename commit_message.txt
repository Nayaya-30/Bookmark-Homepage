fix: correct import path in Header and adjust FAQ button margin

- Fix import path in Header.jsx from "./components/Footer.jsx" to "./Footer.jsx"
- Adjust button margin in FAQ.jsx from mt-4 to my-8 for better spacing
- Add comprehensive task list in docs/tasks.md for project improvements
- Add placeholder for project guidelines in .junie/guidelines.md
- Create X.jsx component as alternative implementation of FAQ (untracked)

This commit addresses issues with the Header component's imports and
improves the UI spacing in the FAQ section. It also adds documentation
for future development tasks and project guidelines.
